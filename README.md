## Let's start

#### First, what MERN stack stands for?

MERN is a full-stack web development framework, composed of four technologies MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS

`MongoDB`: A document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store your app data.

`NodeJS`: It is a JavaScript runtime environment. It provides you with the ability to run JavaScript in a machine rather than in a browser.

`ExpressJS`: A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not developed to make websites but rather run JavaScript on a machine, ExpressJS was developed.

`ReactJS`: It is a library created by Facebook. It is used to build UI components that create the user interface of the single page web application.
